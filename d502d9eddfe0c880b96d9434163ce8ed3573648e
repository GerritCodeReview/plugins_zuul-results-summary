As a CI guy who watches jobs every day and patches with more than 10-20 jobs, it\u0027s really difficult to me now to match result and job name. This solution saves me time and helps me to work efficiently.\nPS. For me it\u0027s not a \"style\" change, but functional one.",

Maybe I guess the whole thing has to go in a \u003cdiv\u003e that narrows it?  \n\nAnother option might be to do a mouseover highlight thing where the whole line/row \"jumps\" as the mouse moves over to pull out the line",
