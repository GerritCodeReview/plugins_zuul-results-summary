I think maybe we should expand this as you\u0027ve suggested so it\u0027s a bit clearer what is matched.\n\nIf you\u0027d like to propose a patch that removes the \"pipeline unknown\" bit that would probably be OK too ðŸ˜Š  If we don\u0027t have a match on the pipeline, we can probably just ignore that",
